# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central knowledge base for OctoAcme's project management processes. This folder contains the team's process documents and templates used to plan, execute, release, and continuously improve projects.

## Overview of Our Approach

We follow a lightweight, customer-focused project management approach that emphasizes rapid, measurable delivery and clear ownership:

- Customer-first: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision.
- Iterative delivery: Work in small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback early.
- Clear ownership: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead who share accountability for outcomes.
- Data-informed decisions: Use metrics and experiments to validate assumptions and guide prioritization.
- Transparency & psychological safety: Encourage open communication, feedback, and learning from outcomes.

Lifecycle phases:
1. Initiation — define value, scope, and stakeholders.
2. Planning — break work into deliverables, estimate, and set milestones.
3. Execution — deliver increments, track progress, and manage risks.
4. Release — coordinate deployment and stakeholder communication.
5. Continuous improvement — run retrospectives and apply learnings.
